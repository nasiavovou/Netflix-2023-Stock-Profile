In this project, I will analyze data extracted from Yahoo Finance to create a stock profile for Netflix for the year 2023. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the publicly-traded company's finances, so as to be better equiped to assess the risk of the Netflix stock.
I will inspect, prepare, analyze and plot the relevant data to examine the following:
1. The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
2. Netflixâ€™s earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
3. The estimated vs. actual earnings per share for the four quarters in 2023
4. A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs. the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2023
